This is slightly different from `oclif generate`, which will create an entirely new oclif project based on our [templates](/docs/templates).\\r\\n\\r\\n`oclif init` will add the following:\\r\\n- bin scripts: `bin/run.js`, `bin/run.cmd`, `bin/dev.js`, and `bin/dev.cmd`\\r\\n- `oclif` section to package.json with `bin`, `dirname`, `commands`, and `topicSeparator` set (See [Configuring Your CLI](/docs/configuring_your_cli) for more)\\r\\n- `@oclif/core` to `dependencies` in your package.json (if it\'s not already there)\\r\\n- `ts-node` to `devDependencies` in your package.json (if it\'s not already there)\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce you\'ve initialized oclif, you can use the [bin scripts](/docs/templates#bin-scripts) to execute your CLI.

It\'s been a while since we last uploaded a blog - and *a lot* has happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\'ve been focusing on these high-level areas over the past couple of years:\\r\\n- Improving `@oclif/core`\\r\\n- ESM Support\\r\\n- Improving and revitalizing oclif.io\\r\\n- Re-engaging the oclif community\\r\\n\\r\\n## Improving `@oclif/core`\\r\\n\\r\\nSince we [announced `@oclif/core` over three years ago](/blog/2021/03/01/introducing-oclif-core), we\'ve released two new major versions, each packed with lots of features that we\'re really excited about.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are some of these changes:\\r\\n- Full support for ESM and interoperability with CommonJS (more on this topic below).\\r\\n- Configurable command discovery strategies that give you more control over how commands are loaded at runtime. Check out the [docs](/docs/command_discovery_strategies).\\r\\n- A new `preparse` hook that allows you to manipulate the provided arguments before they\'re parsed. Salesforce used this hook to [implement](https://github.com/salesforcecli/cli/pull/1536) a neat `--flags-dir` feature that translates local files into flags.\\r\\n- A new `Performance` class that you can use to track performance inside of `@oclif/core` and your own CLI or plugin. Check out the [docs](/docs/performance).\\r\\n- A new flag type, `Flags.option`, that lets you define a flag with a preset list of options. Typescript then uses the options to infer the flag\'s type.\\r\\n- Flags now have a `relationship` property that allows you to define more complex relationships between flags. Check out the [flags docs](/docs/flags) for more information.\\r\\n- Flags now have a `defaultHelp` property that allows you to set the human readable default value in the command help. This property is useful when your flag\'s `parse` method returns a complex type, such as an object or a class. Check out the [flags docs](/docs/flags) for more.\\r\\n- Commands now have a `hiddenAliases` property that allows you to define aliases that you want to hide from the user. The property is super helpful when you\'re trying to wean users off a deprecated command.\\r\\n- You can now use [bun](https://bun.sh/) or [tsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsx) as dev runtimes (as opposed to node or ts-node).\\r\\n- A command\'s usage, args, and flags are now shown whenever a user forgets to provide a required arg or flag, or when they provided a non-existent flag.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you need help migrating to the latest version, head over to [core\'s README](https://github.com/oclif/core/?tab=readme-ov-file#-migrating) which has links to the migration guides. Feel free to open a new [discussion](https://github.com/oclif/core/discussions) if you need more hands-on help from us or the community.\\r\\n\\r\\n## ESM Support\\r\\n\\r\\nVersion 3 of `@oclif/core` introduced full support for developing ESM plugins and CLIs. It also offered full support for interoperability between CommonJS and ESM plugins.\\r\\n\\r\\nPut more simply, you can now migrate your CLI to ESM while keeping individual plugins in CommonJS (or vice versa). The upgrade path is now much simpler for you. You also don\'t need to worry about any community plugins that have migrated to ESM before you did (such as all the `@oclif` plugins) or are staunchly sticking with CommonJS for the foreseeable future.\\r\\n\\r\\nRead more about this topic [here](/docs/esm).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Improving and Revitalizing oclif.io\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother area of focus for us has been improving our documentation site, [oclif.io](htttps://oclif.io).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile improving the quality and accuracy of the documentation was our priority, we also took the time to upgrade to the latest version of [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). This new version gave our site a much-needed facelift, as well as cool new features such as dark mode and announcements.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have any feedback or are running into issues, we want to hear about it. Just create an issue in the [oclif.io repo](https://github.com/oclif/oclif.github.io/issues).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Re-engaging the oclif Community\\r\\n\\r\\nLastly, our biggest priority at the moment is to re-engage the oclif community. We understand how frustrating it has been over the years to see your issues and pull requests go unacknowledged. We apologize for not prioritizing the community, and are earnestly trying to make sure that every issue and pull request gets the attention it deserves going forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also opened up GitHub discussions for [@oclif/core](https://github.com/oclif/core/discussions) and the [oclif CLI](https://github.com/oclif/oclif/discussions), where you can now post your questions or ideas. We hope you take advantage of them, we love hearing from you!\\r\\n\\r\\nOne last thing: we intend to publicly post our roadmap so you have more visibility into what we\'re working on.

It\'s our great pleasure to announce that we have released oclif v2, which uses the new [@oclif/core](https://github.com/oclif/core) library! \ud83c\udf89\\r\\n\\r\\noclif v2 includes many changes that improve the experience of both creating and using an oclif CLI.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing forward, we don\'t plan to make any updates to oclif v1 and its corresponding libraries, except for critical security fixes. See the [compatibility matrix](#compatibility-matrix) for a list of these libraries. In order to give developers time to migrate from v1 to v2, we\'re not completely dropping support yet. But at some point in the future we\'ll archive the v1 repositories and deprecate their versions on npm.\\r\\n\\r\\n## What\u2019s changing?\\r\\n\\r\\n### Repository Changes\\r\\n\\r\\nAll repositories under the [oclif org](https://github.com/oclif/) now use `main` as their primary branch and `oclif-v1` as the legacy branch. The `main`  branch corresponds to oclif v2 and the `oclif-v1` branch to oclif v1. If you find any repos that don\u2019t have a `main` branch, you can safely assume that they\'re not used in oclif v2 and will be deprecated in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Consolidating Tools & Libraries\\r\\n\\r\\nThe [`oclif-dev`](https://github.com/oclif/dev-cli) CLI has now been incorporated into [`oclif`](https://github.com/oclif/oclif). You now no longer need to install a separate package to manage your entire CLI\u2019s lifecycle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following libraries have been consolidated under [`@oclif/core`](https://github.com/oclif/core) and will be deprecated at some point in the future. Read the [migration guide](https://github.com/oclif/core/blob/main/MIGRATION.md) to learn how to update your CLI or plugin to use the new core library.\\r\\n\\r\\n* `@oclif/command`\\r\\n* `@oclif/config`\\r\\n* `@oclif/error`\\r\\n* `@oclif/help`\\r\\n* `@oclif/parser`\\r\\n\\r\\n### No more single vs multi command CLIs\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\'s only one \\"type\\" of oclif v2 CLI, but it can have as few or as many commands as a developer wants. As a result, there\u2019s only one command to generate CLIs, `oclif generate`, as opposed to the old `oclif single` and `oclif multi` commands.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Node > 12\\r\\n\\r\\nTo ensure oclif CLIs are as secure as possible, all v2 libraries and plugins support only Node 12 or higher as of now. Going forward, they\'ll support only Node Maintenance or higher, as defined by Node\'s release schedule here: https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/.\\r\\n\\r\\n## What\u2019s new?\\r\\n\\r\\n### New example CLI\\r\\n\\r\\n[`oclif-hello-world`](https://github.com/oclif/hello-world/) is our new example repo. This is also the repo that\'s [used as a template](https://github.com/oclif/oclif/blob/edc6616e51/src/generators/cli.ts#L74) when running `oclif generate` to create a new CLI. This repo will always be able to be referenced as an example of what an oclif v2 CLI should look like.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Spaced commands\\r\\n\\r\\noclif CLIs can now use spaces, instead of colons, to separate topics and subcommands. To enable this feature, simply add `\u201ctopicSeparator\\": \\" \\"` to the oclif config in your package.json. See an example in our [example repo](https://github.com/oclif/hello-world/blob/main/package.json#L55).\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n// Old commands that use :\\r\\n$ mycli do:something\\r\\n```\\r\\n```\\r\\n// New spaced commands\\r\\n$ mycli do something\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n> Note: Spaced commands are backwards compatible. So if you enable spaced commands for your CLI, users will still be able to use `:` as a separator. This ensures that any existing scripts don\'t break.\\r\\n\\r\\n### New Help Output\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\u2019ve revamped the way command help is outputted to the terminal, making it both easier to implement and easier to read. See the difference between the old help output on the left and the new help output on the right in the screenshots below.\\r\\n\\r\\n<table border=\\"0\\">\\r\\n <tr>\\r\\n    <td>oclif v1</td>\\r\\n    <td>oclif v2</td>\\r\\n </tr>\\r\\n <tr>\\r\\n    <td><img src=\\"/img/2022-01-12-announcing-oclif-v2/sfdx-help.png\\"/></td>\\r\\n    <td><img src=\\"/img/2022-01-12-announcing-oclif-v2/sf-help.png\\"/></td>\\r\\n </tr>\\r\\n</table>\\r\\n\\r\\nNotice that there are new sections for flags and global flags, examples are displayed with better spacing, and there is a section at the bottom called Configuration Variables. This Configuration Variables section is not part of the new help by default. But we\'ve added support for custom help sections, which is what the `sf` CLI uses to create the new section.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Async Command Parsing\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\u2019ve also improved the performance of new CLIs by rewriting how commands are parsed on initialization. The [new parser](https://github.com/oclif/core/blob/main/src/parser/parse.ts) is asynchronous, which makes CLIs with a lot of commands or installed  plugins much faster.\\r\\n\\r\\n## What\u2019s coming next?\\r\\n\\r\\nPart of our charter for the release of oclif v2 includes improving our engagement with the oclif community. We know that over the past couple of years we\u2019ve reduced our involvement, and a lot of issues and PRs have languished in limbo. Hopefully you\u2019ve already seen increased activity and responses from oclif maintainers recently, but if you haven\u2019t, please don\u2019t hesitate to ping us by tagging [@admins](https://github.com/orgs/oclif/teams/admins) in oclif repos.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also want to start interviewing members of the oclif community to acquire feedback and prioritize the features and fixes you deem most important!\\r\\n\\r\\nBest,\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oclif team\\r\\n\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\n### Reference material\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Migration Guide\\r\\n\\r\\nThis guide explains how to upgrade a CLI or plugin from the old oclif v1 libraries to the new `@oclif/core` library that oclif v2 uses.\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://github.com/oclif/core/blob/main/MIGRATION.md\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Compatibility Matrix\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following matrix shows how the v1 libraries and plugins relate to the new v2 ones.

Core CLIs can have 1 or many commands.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with Core, we moved the oclif-dev CLI into the oclif CLI creating a single \\"utility\\" CLI. This CLI also introduces a new AWS S3 compatible publishing scheme.\\r\\n\\r\\n### What to expect in the near future\\r\\n\\r\\nCore is in pre-release beta and being actively developed for new internal Salesforce CLIs.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch documentation needs to be written in the coming months including migration paths. Migration onto Core should be as painless as possible with many exports remaining entirely unchanged. Look for forthcoming blog posts and documentation on [oclif.io](https://oclif.io).\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly this summer, tentively June 1, we will release Core v1. Core\'s release will coincide with major bumps to many other oclif plugin packages. See the compatibility matrix below.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Core\'s v1 release, the current \\"main\\" oclif packages (namely: command, config, errors & parser) will go into maintenance mode until Jan 2022. They will receive _only_ bug and security fixes and they remain compatible with current versions of the oclif and oclif-dev CLIs. Afterwhich, they will be archived.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompanioning Core, the next major release of the oclif CLI (literally `oclif@2`) will generate Core CLIs.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Going forward\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are excited to release Core! We invite you to poke around the [Core repo](https://github.com/oclif/core). It may appear to be a big change but Core keeps what you already enjoy about oclif while reducing development complexity, project dependencies, package coupling and bundle size and introduces many requested features previously too prickly to weave into the current oclif architecture.\\r\\n\\r\\nBest,\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oclif team\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Reference: Compatibility matrix\\r\\n\\r\\n| | oclif \\"v1\\" | oclif \\"Core\\" |\\r\\n| - | - | -|\\r\\n| Utility CLIs | oclif@\\\\<2<br/>@oclif/dev-cli@\\\\<2 | oclif@>=2\\r\\n| Main packages | @oclif/core@\\\\<2<br/>@oclif/config@\\\\<2<br/>@oclif/errors@\\\\<2<br/>@oclif/parser@\\\\<4<br/>@oclif/plugin-help@\\\\<4<br/> | @oclif/core@>=1\\r\\n| Node LTS | Node v8-14 | Node v12+ |\\r\\n| TypeScript | typescript@\\\\<4 | typescript@>=4 |\\r\\n| Main plugins | @oclif/plugin-autocomplete@\\\\<1<br/>@oclif/plugin-commands@\\\\<2<br/>@oclif/plugin-help@\\\\<4<br/>@oclif/plugin-not-found@\\\\<2<br/>@oclif/plugin-plugins@\\\\<2<br/>@oclif/plugin-update@\\\\<2<br/>plugin-warn-if-update-available@\\\\<2<br/>plugin-which@\\\\<2<br/> | @oclif/plugin-autocomplete@>=2<br/>@oclif/plugin-commands@>=2<br/>@oclif/plugin-help@>=4<br/>@oclif/plugin-not-found@>=2<br/>@oclif/plugin-plugins@>=2<br/>@oclif/plugin-update@>=2<br/>@oclif/plugin-warn-if-update-available@>=2<br/>@oclif/plugin-which@>=2<br/> |"},{"id":"/2020/08/26/summer-update","metadata":{"permalink":"/docs/oclif/blog/2020/08/26/summer-update","source":"@site/blog/2020-08-26-summer-update.md","title":"oclif Summer 2020 Update","description":"Hello oclif developers!

TSLint\'s goal has become to work toward a \u201cunified developer experience\u201d by supporting ESLint development going forward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## What has changed in oclif\\r\\n\\r\\nTo keep inline with the community, oclif has transitioned to ESLint for all our core libraries as well as all our official plugins.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting in v1.15.x, oclif will now optionally generate projects with ESLint for both TypeScript and JavaScript CLI\u2019s.\\r\\n\\r\\nESLint does require Node to be on stable LTS version, at the time of writing, Node 8.10.x, Node 10.13.x & Node 12.x.x.\\r\\n\\r\\n## How does this affect you\\r\\n\\r\\nExisting CLI\u2019s are unchanged, but any newly generated CLI\'s will only give the option of using ESLint. If you are running tslint in your CLI, we recommend you switch to ESLint as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn migrating our projects we took the following steps (for an example of these changes see this [pull request](https://github.com/oclif/githubcli/pull/10)).\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Install eslint\\r\\n\\r\\n    `$ yarn add eslint eslint-config-oclif eslint-config-oclif-typescript --dev`\\r\\n2. Add eslint related files\\r\\n```shell\\r\\n$ echo \'{\\r\\n  \\"extends\\": [\\r\\n    \\"oclif\\",\\r\\n    \\"oclif-typescript\\"\\r\\n  ],\\r\\n  \\"rules\\": {\\r\\n  }\\r\\n}\' > .eslintrc\\r\\n```\\r\\n3. Remove tslint and related packages\\r\\n\\r\\n    `$ yarn remove @oclif/tslint tslint`\\r\\n4. Remove tslint related configuration files\\r\\n\\r\\n    `$ rm tslint.json`\\r\\n5. Change lint script in our package.json from something like:\\r\\n\\r\\n    `\\"lint\\": \\"tsc -p test --noEmit && tslint -p test -t stylish\\"`\\r\\n    \\r\\n    to\\r\\n    \\r\\n    `\\"lint\\": \\"eslint . --ext .ts --config .eslintrc\\"`\\r\\n\\r\\nTo preserve the test compile (tsc -p test --noEmit) we also made the following updates to our scripts:\\r\\n\\r\\n`\\"pretest\\": \\"tsc -p test --noEmit\\"`\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some cases we had our posttest duplicating the same steps as our lint script so it\u2019s cleaner to have it reference the lint job directly with:\\r\\n\\r\\n`\\"posttest\\": \\"yarn lint\\"`\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Run `yarn lint --fix`. This attempts to auto-fix any linting violations automatically. In the case an auto-fix isn\u2019t available it should be fixed manually or ignored (see the [eslint configuration doc](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring) for more information) \\r\\n7. Do a search in the codebase for `tslint` and remove any unnecessary tslint disabling comments, like: \\r\\n```javascript\\r\\n/* tslint:disable:object-literal-sort-keys */\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are on a version of Node that is not supported by ESLint, you will also need to update your Node engine. ESLint supports Node 8, 10, and 12 so you should upgrade to the most recent Node version compatible with your CLI and also supported by ESLint (see ESLint\'s [Installation and Usage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint#installation-and-usage) instructions).\\r\\n\\r\\n## When will this take effect\\r\\n\\r\\nThese changes have taken effect in oclif v1.15.1.

Let\u2019s take a look at a few ways we will be supporting these changes.\\r\\n\\r\\n## CI Environments\\r\\n\\r\\nCLIs created with the oclif cli going forward will be generated with a CircleCI configuration with Node 10 & 12 and an Appveyor configuration using Node 10. We have also added Node latest to CircleCi to be an early warning detection against coming Node changes (Node latest is managed by CircleCI).\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have already updated every oclif repo\'s CI configs to reflect this.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf your existing CLI uses either Appveyor or CircleCI you can update your config files also, like so:\\r\\n\\r\\n### .circleci/config.yml\\r\\n\\r\\nYour CircleCI config should contain a `node-latest` job, aliased as `test`. From this, there should be two extensions of this job for the Active LTS Node versions, Node 10 and Node 12.\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n  node-10:\\r\\n    <<: *node-latest\\r\\n    docker:\\r\\n      - image: node:10\\r\\n  node-12:\\r\\n    <<: *node-latest\\r\\n    docker:\\r\\n      - image: node:12\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nNotice that these declarations only change the Docker Node images used to run that job.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, the jobs listed within workflows must also be updated to reflect our changes in configuration:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n    jobs:\\r\\n      - node-latest\\r\\n      - node-10\\r\\n      - node-12\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### appveyor.yml\\r\\n\\r\\nFor appveyor we are currently only testing the oldest Active LTS Node version, Node 10. Update the `nodejs_version` proppert in your appveyor.yml file to reflect this.\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nenvironment:\\r\\n  nodejs_version: \\"10\\"\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Deprecating Node 8 & Updating packge.json engines\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Jan 2020, Node will end its Node 8 maintenance. We will follow suit by setting the package.json engine property in oclif packages to `>=10` and bumping the package\'s major versions.\\r\\n\\r\\nDepending on how you ship your CLI you may wish to also bump the engines version in your CLI\'s package.json. You can read more about the implications of the engines property configuration in the [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#engines).\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso consider distributing your CLI with [its own Node version](https://oclif.io/docs/releasing#standalone-tarballs).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Packaged Node Version\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen using dev-cli to pack your CLI it will use the Node version as specified in your package.json under the `oclif.update.node.version` property. This value should reflect an Active LTS Node version (dev-cli does not currently enforce versions).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Supporting the future\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a community we may discover bumps along the way as we upgrade. If you notice something related to oclif please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request under the relevant oclif package within [the org](https://github.com/oclif).\\r\\n\\r\\nWe look forward to using the latest from Node and the community and keeping oclif healthy along the way."},{"id":"/2019/09/16/oclifconf-recap","metadata":{"permalink":"/docs/oclif/blog/2019/09/16/oclifconf-recap","source":"@site/blog/2019-09-16-oclifconf-recap.md","title":"oclifconf 2019: A Recap","description":"In May, Heroku and Salesforce Open Source organized oclifconf, a conference for developers & product managers building CLI tools on top of the open source oclif framework.

Enjoy!\\r\\n\\r\\n## The future of oclif by Jeff Dickey\\r\\n\\r\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1TKh2YBxRMY\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its relatively short lifetime, oclif has already inspired many developers and companies to adopt its framework as a means for implementing their own command-line tooling. In this talk, Jeff Dickey, an oclif founding team member, recaps the project\'s history and inspiration. He also looks towards the future and outlines some features and improvements that the tool could adapt. This isn\'t so much a definitive roadmap of where oclif is headed, but rather, a call to inspiration for developers eager to contribute! And if you are interested in contributing, check out the [open issues](https://github.com/oclif/oclif/issues) in the oclif GitHub repo and come say \\"Hello!\\" on [Spectrum Chat](https://spectrum.chat/oclif).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Open Source Citizenship by Josh Simmons\\r\\n\\r\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/54hhR5DoV6g\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it comes to open source, it\'s more than just individuals now. More and more frequently, large corporations are contributing to projects by donating to contributors, sponsoring events, or upstreaming contributions. But keeping open source projects and communities healthy requires more than just money and brainpower. Josh Simmons surveyed multiple open source communities and relays his findings as to what help maintainers and contributors actually need in this talk.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Building an enterprise-grade CLI with oclif by Thomas Dvornik\\r\\n\\r\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/v4saIi5zoy8\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\\r\\n\\r\\nSecurity and performance are all about trust. While oclif is an extremely extensible framework for building CLI tooling, there are additional requirements to fulfill for enterprise businesses to adopt it that might not be necessary for individual developers. Thomas Dvornik outlines what he and his colleagues at Salesforce have implemented as plugins to oclif to satisfy these needs, including encrypted OAuth, plugin signing, lazy loading dependencies, synchronizing weekly releases and deprecations across dozens of repositories, and establishing cross-team coding and documentation standards.\\r\\n\\r\\n## How Adobe I/O built an extensible CLI with oclif by Jesse MacFadyen\\r\\n\\r\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Mxhx1wmoHlA\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps oclif\'s most appealing feature is its support for plugins. In Cordova\'s case, they\'ve created a sophisticated telemetry system that helps Adobe developers see which commands users are using--and reports on which ones are erroring out. By embedding a feedback system into the tool, users are even able to quickly send their suggestions to a form, without ever leaving the terminal. Jesse MacFadyen demonstrates how oclif\'s plugin system can work beyond simply executing commands.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Integrating oclif with GraphQL and Apollo by Evans Hauser\\r\\n\\r\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Zh78npkypas\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Evans Hauser and the team at Apollo, oclif is best thought of as \\"React for the CLI.\\" As a client paired with a strongly-typed API contract to a server, it can deliver structured and consistent commands to retrieve external data. What better mechanism to use for this transfer than GraphQL, a framework which empowers the client to ask precisely for the data it needs, and nothing more?\\r\\n\\r\\n## Adaptive Intent-based CLI State Machines by Shawn Wang\\r\\n\\r\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZueoIYnHiaI\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\\r\\n\\r\\nIn designing oclif, [Jeff Dickey wrote out 12 CLI factors to keep in mind](https://medium.com/@jdxcode/12-factor-cli-apps-dd3c227a0e46). In this talk, Shawn Wang outlines a 13th: state. State is hard, because it depends on context, and context depends on understanding what a user intends to do, not what they are asking. Shawn is working towards enabling oclif to better understand the commands a user has entered, so that it can predict and interpret future commands that might be entered next. This would enable CLI tools to not just interpret a users\' commands, but to also interpret their intent."},{"id":"/2019/02/20/cli-flags-explained","metadata":{"permalink":"/docs/oclif/blog/2019/02/20/cli-flags-explained","source":"@site/blog/2019-02-20-cli-flags-explained.md","title":"CLI Flags Explained","description":"oclif makes it easy to create a command line interface (CLI) in node.

Most commands have **parameters** \u2014 also known as \\"flags\\", \\"args\\", and sometimes \\"options\\". This blog post explains what these parameters are and when to use them. We also have a new feature that makes it easier for users to detect typos when using parameters.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Note the following describes GNU-style flags. Not all CLIs follow this convention, but it is the most commonly used._\\r\\n\\r\\n## Parts of Speech\\r\\n\\r\\nAny command line interface command has a few standard \\"parts of speech\\".  As a user of CLI tools, knowing these parts of speech can help you make fewer typos. It can also help you understand complex commands other people share with you more quickly. If you are designing a CLI tool it is even more important to understand these parts of speech, so you can come up with the most ergonomic interface for your users.\\r\\n\x3c!-- DIAGRAM OF PARTS OF SPEECH EXAMPLE --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the many ways you can pass data to a CLI command, three of them are **parameters** that are always to the \\"right\\" of the command. The three types of parameters are **argument**, **short flag**, and **long flag**.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Example `ls`\\r\\nOne of the  most common and simplest unix commands is `ls` which \\"lists\\" the contents of a directory.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### command\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nls\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThis command `ls` works on its own, as a standalone **command**. Without any parameters this command will list the contents of the current folder, using an implied `.` directory.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### argument\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nls .\\r\\nls ~/code/some-repo-name\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you pass a command **argument** to this command, like the directory name `.` (current folder) or `~/code/some-repo-name`, it will list the contents of that directory instead.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn argument is anything to the right of a command that is not a flag. An argument can come before or after flags.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Long flag\\r\\nTo list additional files that are normally hidden (like `~/.bashrc`), you can use a flag on the `ls` command. `ls --all` is the **long flag** form. A long flag always uses a double dash, and it is always represented by multiple characters.\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nls --all\\r\\nls . --all\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Short flag\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is also a **short flag** form of this flag: `ls -a`. The `a` is short for `all` in this case. A short flag always uses a single dash, and it is always represented by a single letter.\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nls -a\\r\\nls . -a\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nShort flags can **stack** too, so you don\'t need a separate dash for each one. Order does not matter for these, unless passing a flag argument.\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nls -la\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Flag arguments\\r\\nMany flags accept an **option**, which is a \\"flag argument\\" (as opposed to a \\"command argument\\"). In general a command\'s parameters can be in any order, but flags that accept options must have the option directly after the flag.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor an example, here the `-x` flag does not accept an option but the `-f` flag does. `archive.tar` is the option being passed to `-f`.\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\ntar -x -f archive.tar\\r\\ntar -xf archive.tar\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nA flag and its option can be separated by a space ` ` or an equals sign `=`. Interestingly, short flags (but not long flags) can even skip the space, although many people find it much easier to read with the space or equals sign.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese three are all valid and equivalent:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\ntar -f archive.tar\\r\\ntar -f=archive.tar\\r\\ntar -farchive.tar\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nLong flags must have a space or equals sign to separate the flag from its option.\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\ngit log --pretty=oneline\\r\\ngit log --pretty oneline\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Other Ways of Passing Data\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\'ve covered **parameters**, which are **arguments**, **short flags** and **long flags**. There are two other ways to pass data to a command: **environment variables** (\\"env vars\\"), or **standard input** (\\"stdin\\"). These won\'t be covered in this blog post.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Designing a Command\\r\\n\\r\\nScenario: we want to design an oclif command that echos an input like \\"Casey\\", and returns \\"hi, Casey!\\". There are many ways the user could pass this in, and here we show an example of each type of input.\\r\\n\\r\\n### argument\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\ngreet-me Casey\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### short flag with argument\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\ngreet-me -n Casey\\r\\ngreet-me -n=Casey\\r\\ngreet-me -nCasey\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### long flag with argument\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\ngreet-me --name=Casey\\r\\ngreet-me --name Casey\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### environment variable\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nNAME=Casey greet-me\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### standard input\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\necho \\"Casey\\" | greet-me\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Command ergonomics\\r\\n\\r\\n### Short flag vs long flag\\r\\nMany CLI commands allow for both long flag and short flag forms. In the Heroku CLI every flag has at least a long flag form and roughly half of the flags also have a short flag form.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe long flag form is easier to read, but takes more characters to type. It is often most useful when you want someone to understand a particular command statement quickly and easily, such as in a README.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe short flag form is quicker to type, and is often better for frequently used commands. Short flags are especially useful when stacking short flags together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- ## Did you mean?\\r\\nIt is really easy to make a typo and use one dash instead of two, or vice versa. This \\"Long flag / short flag mismatch\\" is quite common. We hope that by catching these typos we will help you make fewer typos, save you from frustration, and speed up your development.\\r\\n\\r\\n`oclif` can now detect when you accidentally have the wrong number of dashes for a command, and suggest a change to the command.\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nheroku config --s\\r\\n> did you mean \\"heroku config -s\\"?\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nheroku config -something-long\\r\\n> did you mean \\"heroku config --something-long\\"?\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nheroku config ---something-long\\r\\n> did you mean to use FEWER DASHES? (something like this?)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is an example of a \\"did you mean?\\" command, like this ruby plugin [did_you_mean](https://github.com/yuki24/did_you_mean).\\r\\n--\x3e"},{"id":"/2018/03/20/introducing-oclif","metadata":{"permalink":"/docs/oclif/blog/2018/03/20/introducing-oclif","source":"@site/blog/2018-03-20-introducing-oclif.md","title":"Introducing oclif","description":"Introducing oclif","date":"2018-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":0.285,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jeff Dickey"}],"frontMatter":{"author":"Jeff Dickey","title":"Introducing oclif"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"CLI Flags Explained","permalink":"/docs/oclif/blog/2019/02/20/cli-flags-explained"}},"content":"![Introducing oclif](/img/2018-03-20-introducing-oclif/header.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nCoding for the browser takes serious time. You need to deal with front-end JS, CSS, design, product, and a ton more. On the other hand, building for a CLI takes a fraction of the effort. This makes CLIs particularly great for prototyping out new functionality, offering admin/internal tools, or power-user functionality.\\r\\n\\r\\n<a class=\\"button\\" href=\\"https://engineering.salesforce.com/open-sourcing-oclif-the-cli-framework-that-powers-our-clis-21fbda99d33a\\">Read More</a>"}]}')}}]);
